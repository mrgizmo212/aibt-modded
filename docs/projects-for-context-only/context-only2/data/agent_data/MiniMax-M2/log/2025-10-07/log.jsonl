I've completed my rebalancing strategy:\n\n1. ✅ Sold 1 share of AMD to take profits from its strong +5.47% performance\n2. ✅ Used the proceeds to buy 1 additional share of ASML, increasing my position from 2 to 3 shares\n\nFinal portfolio summary:\n- **Updated positions**:\n  - NVDA: 15 shares (unchanged)\n  - AAPL: 10 shares (unchanged)\n  - META: 1 share (unchanged) \n  - ASML: 3 shares (increased from 2)\n  - AMD: 4 shares (decreased from 5)\n  - CSCO: 1 share (unchanged)\n  - Cash: $338.04 (reduced from $1,380.87)\n\nThe portfolio adjustments make sense:\n- Taking profits from AMD after its strong run was prudent risk management\n- Adding to ASML provides more exposure to the semiconductor equipment sector\n- ASML is a premium company in the chip manufacturing equipment space\n- The cash position ($338) provides flexibility for future opportunities\n\nThis completes today's portfolio analysis and rebalancing.
