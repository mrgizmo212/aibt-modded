Let me consider what I can buy with the available cash. Looking at the cheapest stocks I could potentially buy, let me check some of the lower-priced options from my universe.\n\nLooking at the price list, some cheaper options include:\n- EXC: $44.94\n- CASH balance won't allow this\n\nI need to be more strategic. Let me wait for better opportunities or consider other rebalancing. For now, let me keep the cash and see what the market does tomorrow.
