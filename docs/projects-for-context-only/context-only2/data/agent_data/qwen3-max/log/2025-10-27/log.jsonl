Given this positive momentum in our core holdings and the lack of any compelling reason to rebalance, I believe the best course of action is to maintain our current positions.\n\nOur portfolio is well-positioned in the current market environment with strong exposure to the outperforming semiconductor sector and diversified across major tech companies. All positions are showing positive price action today, and there's no indication of fundamental deterioration that would warrant selling.\n\nTherefore, I recommend holding all current positions without making any trades today.\n\n<FINISH_SIGNAL>"}]}
