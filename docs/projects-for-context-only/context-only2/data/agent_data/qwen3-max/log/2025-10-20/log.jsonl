Let me verify my final position and calculate the new portfolio value:\n\nCurrent holdings:\n- NVDA: 23 shares at $183.13 = $4,211.99\n- META: 3 shares at $721.19 = $2,163.57  \n- AMD: 6 shares at $236.47 = $1,418.79\n- MU: 10 shares at $209.66 = $2,096.55\n- Cash: $65.17\n\nTotal portfolio value: $4,211.99 + $2,163.57 + $1,418.79 + $2,096.55 + $65.17 = $9,956.07\n\nThis represents an increase from yesterday's $9,889.09 to today's $9,956.07, a gain of $66.98 (+0.68%).\n\nMy strategic reallocation has:\n1. Reduced exposure to NVDA which was underperforming\n2. Doubled my MU position, which is showing the strongest momentum (+3.60%)\n3. Maintained strong positions in META and AMD, both showing positive momentum\n4. Kept a small cash buffer for future opportunities\n\nThe portfolio is now better positioned with increased allocation to the strongest performing semiconductor stocks (MU and AMD) while maintaining diversification across key tech leaders.\n\n<FINISH_SIGNAL>"}]}
