However, without specific rebalancing instructions or target allocations, and given that all positions are showing positive momentum, I'll maintain the current positions for today.\n\nSince the task is to \"analyze and update today's positions\" and there are no specific trading signals or rebalancing rules provided, and all current holdings are performing well (especially AMD with a strong 5.47% gain), I'll keep the existing positions unchanged.\n\n<FINISH_SIGNAL>"}]}
