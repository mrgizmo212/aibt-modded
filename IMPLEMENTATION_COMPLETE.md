## 🎯 FEATURES IMPLEMENTED

### **1. Run Tracking System** ✅

**Database:**
```sql
trading_runs table:
  - run_number (auto-incrementing per model)
  - strategy_snapshot (rules/params used)
  - results (trades, return, drawdown)
  - timestamps and status
```

**Backend:**
- `services/run_service.py` - Full CRUD
- Creates run on trading start
- Completes run with final stats
- Links all trades via run_id

**Frontend:**
- `/models/[id]/r/[run]` - Run detail page
- Recent runs list on model page
- Click to view any run

**Result:** Users can now compare Run #1 vs Run #2!

---

### **2. AI Reasoning Audit Trail** ✅

**Database:**
```sql
ai_reasoning table:
  - reasoning_type ('plan' | 'analysis' | 'decision' | 'reflection')
  - content (AI's thought process)
  - context_json (what AI was looking at)
```

**Backend:**
- `services/reasoning_service.py`
- Saves reasoning for every trade decision
- Also saves to positions.reasoning (quick ref)

**Result:** Complete audit trail of WHY AI made each decision!

---

### **3. System Agent (Chat)** ✅

**Backend:**
- `agents/system_agent.py` - Conversational AI
- `agents/tools/analyze_trades.py` - Pattern analysis
- `agents/tools/suggest_rules.py` - Rule recommendations
- `agents/tools/calculate_metrics.py` - Performance stats
- `services/chat_service.py` - Conversation storage

**API Endpoints:**
```
POST /api/models/{id}/runs/{run_id}/chat
GET  /api/models/{id}/runs/{run_id}/chat-history
GET  /api/models/{id}/runs
GET  /api/models/{id}/runs/{run_id}
```

**Frontend:**
- ChatInterface component (full chat UI)
- RunData component (run visualization)
- Chat history loads automatically
- Suggested questions for easy start

**Result:** Users chat with AI to understand and improve!

---

### **4. Structured Rules** ✅

**Database:**
```sql
model_rules table:
  - rule_category (risk, strategy, timing, etc.)
  - enforcement_params (JSONB - programmatic!)
  - priority, is_active
  - applies_to_assets, symbols
```

**Backend:**
- `utils/rule_enforcer.py` - Validates trades
- Checks position size limits
- Checks max positions
- Checks cash reserves
- Checks timing blackouts

**Integration:**
- Intraday trading validates EVERY trade
- Shows rejection reasons
- Counts rule violations

**Result:** Programmatic risk enforcement (no more 62% drawdowns!)

---

### **5. Risk Gates** ✅

**Backend:**
- `utils/risk_gates.py` - Hard-coded safety
- Gate 1: Prevent negative cash
- Gate 2: Prevent selling more than owned
- Gate 3: Prevent covering shorts you don't have
- Gate 4: Daily loss circuit breaker
- Gate 5: 25% max drawdown hard limit
- Gate 6: 50% max position size hard limit
- Gate 7: 10% minimum cash reserve

**Result:** Cannot be disabled - baseline safety for all users!

---

### **6. Custom Rules in Intraday** ✅

**Before:** Intraday ignored custom rules ❌  
**Now:** Rules included in AI prompt ✅

**Code:**
- `agent_prompt.py` - Added custom_rules parameter
- `intraday_agent.py` - Passes rules to prompt

**Result:** AI sees and follows user rules for every decision!

---

### **7. Multi-User Security** ✅

**RLS Policies:**
- All 6 new tables have RLS
- Policies chain through models.user_id
- Admin policies for oversight

**Code Verification:**
- All services verify ownership
- All endpoints check auth
- PermissionError raised if wrong user

**Result:** Complete multi-user isolation maintained!

---

## 🔧 TECHNICAL ARCHITECTURE

### **Two-Agent System (Designed)**

```
Analysis Agent (Future):
├─ Monitor markets
├─ Gather intelligence (finmcp, uwmcp, finviz)
├─ Run technical analysis
├─ Detect signals
└─ Emit events

Execution Agent (Current):
├─ Validate against rules
├─ Run risk gates
├─ Execute trades
├─ Log reasoning
└─ Update positions
```

### **Data Flow**

```
User starts intraday → Creates Run #1
  ↓
Trading Agent makes decisions
  ↓
Rule Enforcer validates (user rules)
  ↓
Risk Gates validate (hard safety)
  ↓
Trade executes → Saves to positions
  ↓
AI Reasoning → Saves to ai_reasoning
  ↓
Run completes → Updates trading_runs
  ↓
User navigates to /models/[id]/r/1
  ↓
System Agent available for chat
  ↓
User asks "Why lose money?"
  ↓
AI analyzes using tools
  ↓
Conversation saved to chat_messages
```

## 🎯 USER EXPERIENCE

### **Before Today:**
```
User: Starts intraday trading
System: Executes 30 trades
Result: -2.40%, 62% drawdown
User: "What happened?" → No way to know
Rules: Ignored for intraday
Organization: Flat list of trades
Analysis: None
Learning: None
```

### **After Implementation:**
```
User: Starts intraday trading
System: Creates Run #1
  → Validates every trade (rules + gates)
  → Saves AI reasoning for each decision
  → Records to trading_runs table
  
User: Clicks "Run #1"
  → See complete performance
  → See strategy used
  → See AI reasoning count
  
User: Chats with AI
  → "Why did I lose money?"
  → AI analyzes and explains
  → Suggests specific rules
  → Conversation saves
  
User: Adds suggested rule
  → Rule enforced on next run
  
User: Starts Run #2 (same data, new rules)
  → Compare results
  → Iterate and improve
```

```

**Learning from AI:**
```
Chat: "Why did this trade lose?"
AI: "You bought at resistance level, high RSI"
Chat: "Create a rule"
AI: "Don't buy when RSI > 70"
Apply rule → Next run avoids this mistake
```

**Complete Audit:**
```
Every decision logged
Every trade has reasoning
Every rule violation recorded
Complete transparency
```
