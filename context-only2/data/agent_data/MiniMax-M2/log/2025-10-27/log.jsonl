After a stunning recovery from tariff-induced hysteria in Q2, stocks added to their gains in impressive fashion. The S&P 500® Index and Russell 2000® Index advanced 8.1% and 12.4%. Year-to-date, the indices finished the quarter up 14.8% and 10.4%, respectively. Recall, the S&P and Russell were down roughly 15% and 21% year-to-date earlier this year (4/8/25) when economic fears peaked. Since then, the S&P has risen for five straight months.\n\nFirst, the good news. Corporate earnings and the economy have remained resilient even in the face of tariffs. For the second quarter, over 80% of S&P 500 constituents beat earnings expectations compared to a longer-term average closer to 60%. Gross Domestic Product (GDP) growth remained strong at 3.8% and estimates for the third quarter have recently been revised upward.

Tech stocks are performing well in Q3 2025 (up 8% for the quarter)\n2. The Fed has cut interest rates, which should benefit growth stocks\n3. AI and technology stocks continue to drive market gains\n4. Small-cap stocks have been rallying as rates fall\n\nHowever, I notice that some of my stocks had negative price changes today:\n- NVDA: $186.26 → $189.99 (up $3.73, +2.00%)\n- MSFT: $523.61 → $531.78 (up $8.17, +1.56%)\n- AAPL: $262.82 → $264.88 (up $2.06, +0.78%)\n- AMZN: $224.21 → $227.66 (up $3.45, +1.54%)\n- PEP: $151.55 → $151.01 (down $0.54, -0.36%)\n- AMGN: $291.76 → $291.21 (down $0.55, -0.19%)\n- CMCSA: $29.28 → $29.405 (up $0.125, +0.43%)\n\nActually, most of my holdings are up today, with only PEP and AMGN showing small declines.\n\nGiven that I now have $48.63 in cash and most of my positions are performing well, I should consider:\n1. Adding to my winning positions (especially the strong tech performers)\n\n\n2. Rebalancing my portfolio to take advantage of current market trends\n3. Potentially diversifying with new investments in small-cap or emerging sectors\n\nI'm carefully evaluating my investment strategy. My tech holdings are performing strongly, and the overall market environment suggests continued growth potential. I'll assess whether to increase my positions in NVDA, MSFT, or AAPL, or explore new opportunities that could provide additional returns.\n</think>\n\nI can see that the portfolio has been updated after selling all WBD shares.
