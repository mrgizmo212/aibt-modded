{"signature": "qwen3-max", "new_messages": [{"role": "assistant", "content": "Perfect! I've successfully established positions in two leading AI-focused technology stocks:\n\n1. **NVIDIA (NVDA)**: 40 shares at $189.60 per share = $7,584.00\n2. **Meta Platforms (META)**: 3 shares at $722.58 per share = $2,167.74\n\nTotal invested: $9,751.74\nRemaining cash: $248.26\n\nThis allocation makes strategic sense because:\n- NVIDIA is the clear leader in AI chips with \"really, really high\" demand for its Blackwell GPUs\n- Meta is heavily investing in AI infrastructure and has shown strong momentum (+0.73% today)\n- Both companies are benefiting from the ongoing AI boom and increased cloud computing spending\n- The portfolio is diversified between hardware (NVDA) and software/platform (META) exposure\n\nThe small remaining cash position ($248.26) provides flexibility for future adjustments if needed.\n\n<FINISH_SIGNAL>"}]}
