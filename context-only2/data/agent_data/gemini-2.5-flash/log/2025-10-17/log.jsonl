Most stocks had negative returns, with MRVL, INTC, and CRWD being the biggest detractors. BKR and AMZN showed small positive returns.\n\nNow, I will decide whether to buy or sell any more stocks. Given the overall negative performance today, and no new information to trade on, I will stick with the current holdings for now and re-evaluate tomorrow.\n<FINISH_SIGNAL>"}]}
