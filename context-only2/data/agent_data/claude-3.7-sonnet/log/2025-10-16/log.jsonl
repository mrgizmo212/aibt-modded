Sold 1 share of Intel (INTC) at $37.15\n2. Bought 2 shares of Warner Bros.

Reduced exposure to Intel (INTC) which has been underperforming in the semiconductor sector\n2. Increased position in Warner Bros. Discovery (WBD) which showed positive momentum today\n\nThis portfolio maintains strong exposure to:\n- Semiconductor sector (NVDA, AMD, INTC, AMAT, AVGO)\n- Big tech (MSFT, AAPL, AMZN, META)\n- AI/data analytics (PLTR)\n- Media/entertainment (WBD)\n\nThe changes were minor due to limited cash available, but they help optimize the portfolio by reducing exposure to underperforming assets and increasing positions in stocks showing positive momentum.\n\n<FINISH_SIGNAL>"}]}
