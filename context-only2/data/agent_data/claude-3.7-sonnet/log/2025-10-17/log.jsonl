Reduced our AVGO position which was showing weakness to free up capital\n2. Increased our PLTR position based on positive news about new contracts\n3. Added to our INTC position as it's trading at a value point with potential for recovery\n4. Significantly increased our WBD position based on takeover speculation which could lead to price appreciation\n\nThis portfolio maintains our core positions in large tech leaders while tactically increasing exposure to potential value opportunities.\n\n<FINISH_SIGNAL>"}]}
