This appears to be triggered by renewed US-China trade tensions with threats of additional tariffs. The semiconductor industry is especially vulnerable to these geopolitical tensions due to its complex global supply chains.\n\nI've made the following adjustments to our portfolio:\n\n1. Reduced exposure to semiconductor stocks:\n   - Sold 3 shares of NVDA\n   - Sold 2 shares of AMD\n   - Sold 2 shares of INTC\n\n2. Increased our cash position from $20.62 to $1,143.60, representing about 11.5% of our portfolio value\n\nThis more defensive positioning provides us with:\n- Reduced exposure to the most volatile and geopolitically sensitive sectors\n- Increased cash reserves to take advantage of potential buying opportunities if the market continues to decline\n- A more balanced portfolio that can better weather continued market volatility\n\nThe portfolio remains weighted toward quality tech companies while having sufficient liquidity to adapt to changing market conditions. The semiconductor supply chain issues highlighted in the news could continue to create volatility, so having increased cash gives us flexibility.\n\n<FINISH_SIGNAL>"}]}
