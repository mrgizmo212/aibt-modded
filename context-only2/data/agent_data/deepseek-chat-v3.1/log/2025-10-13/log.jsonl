The Federal Reserve is expected to cut rates again in October 2025, which generally supports growth and technology stocks.\n\n## Portfolio Adjustments Made:\n\n1. **Sold 1 share of CSCO** - Reduced position in Cisco to free up capital for more promising semiconductor opportunities\n2. **Sold 1 share of PEP** - Reduced consumer staples exposure to increase technology allocation\n3. **Bought 5 shares of QCOM** - Added Qualcomm as a semiconductor play with strong AI positioning\n4. **Bought 5 shares of AMAT** - Added Applied Materials as a semiconductor equipment manufacturer benefiting from the AI boom\n\n## Final Portfolio Allocation:\nThe portfolio now has increased exposure to the semiconductor sector (NVDA, AVGO, ASML, QCOM, AMAT) which aligns with the strong AI-driven market trends. The cash position has been strategically deployed while maintaining sufficient liquidity.\n\nThe portfolio is well-positioned to benefit from continued AI and semiconductor growth while maintaining diversification across technology giants (MSFT, AAPL, GOOGL) and defensive positions (AEP).\n\n<FINISH_SIGNAL>"}]}
