Sold 2 shares of AMD to take profits after the OpenAI partnership news drove prices up significantly\n2. Bought 2 shares of GOOGL (Alphabet) for diversification and growth exposure\n3. Bought 1 share of CSCO (Cisco) as a value play with remaining cash\n\n**Result:**\n- Reduced overweight AMD position from 21.6% to ~17.2% \n- Added diversification with GOOGL and CSCO\n- Maintained core positions in quality semiconductor stocks (NVDA, MSFT, AVGO, ASML)\n- Portfolio remains well-positioned for tech sector growth while reducing concentration risk\n\n<FINISH_SIGNAL>"}]}
