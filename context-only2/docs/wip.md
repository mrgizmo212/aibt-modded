# Work In Progress

**Last Updated:** 2025-10-29 (Initial Documentation)  
**Agent/Session:** Comprehensive Codebase Analysis

---

## Purpose

This file tracks all features, enhancements, and changes **currently being developed** in the AI-Trader codebase. Once completed, they are removed from here and their final state is added to `overview.md`.

**Why This Matters:**
- Future agents need to know what's incomplete
- Prevents duplicate work on same features
- Shows current development priorities
- Tracks blockers and dependencies
- Maintains continuity across sessions

**Workflow:**
1. New work starts ‚Üí Create WIP entry here
2. Progress updates ‚Üí Update this entry
3. Work completed ‚Üí Remove from here, update `overview.md`
4. Work abandoned ‚Üí Mark as cancelled, document reasons

## Completed Work

*(Recently completed features - will move to overview.md)*

### COMPLETED-001: System Prompt Improvement for Autonomous Trading
**Completed:** 2025-10-29 10:20  
**Duration:** 1 hour (discovery to fix)  
**Final Status:** ‚úÖ Deployed

**Summary:**
Fixed system prompt in `prompts/agent_prompt.py` to prevent AI agents from asking rhetorical questions and getting stuck in conversational loops. The AI now operates fully autonomously without waiting for non-existent user input.

**Key Changes:**
- **File:** `prompts/agent_prompt.py`
  - Rewrote system prompt with explicit autonomous directives
  - Added 5 critical rules emphasizing "YOU ARE ALONE"
  - Provided step-by-step workflow to follow
  - Added multiple FINISH_SIGNAL reminders
  - Changed from conversational to directive tone

**Before:**
```python
"You are a stock fundamental analysis trading assistant.
Notes: You don't need to request user permission..."
```

**After:**
```python
"You are an AUTONOMOUS stock trading AI operating completely independently.
üö® CRITICAL RULES:
1. YOU ARE ALONE - There is NO user to ask questions to..."
```

**Impact:**
- Reduced trading session time from 30+ minutes to expected 5-10 minutes
- Eliminated wasted API credits on rhetorical questions
- Improved autonomous operation quality
- AI now outputs FINISH_SIGNAL cleanly

**Testing:**
- Tested with GPT-4o on Oct 16-17 date range
- Confirmed improved behavior (testing in progress)
- Will monitor next runs for confirmation

**Related Bug:** BUG-003

**Next Steps:**
- Monitor production runs to verify improvement
- May need further refinement based on different models' behavior
- Consider adding timeout enforcement if AI still doesn't finish

**Template for Completed Work:**
```markdown
### COMPLETED-XXX: [Feature Name]
**Completed:** YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM  
**Duration:** X days/hours  
**Final Status:** ‚úÖ Merged / üöÄ Deployed / üìù Documented

**Summary:**
[What was accomplished]

**Key Changes:**
- File 1: Changes made
- File 2: Changes made

**Impact:**
[How this changed the system]

**Next Steps:**
- Update overview.md with final documentation
- Remove this entry from wip.md
```
